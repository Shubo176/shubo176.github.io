    <h2>Model Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Guided by Associate Professor Si Chen, I developed a complete analysis pipeline for detecting DNA phosphorothioate (PT) modifications from Nanopore signals. The pipeline starts from raw electrical signals and produces model-based predictions at genomic positions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The study used three <em>Salmonella</em> samples: <strong>xtg103</strong> (unmodified control), <strong>sal87</strong> (containing both modified and unmodified sites), and a fully PT-modified plasmid. Signals were basecalled and aligned to the reference genome; event mappings were built to k-mers. For each 21 bp window, a <strong>21×36</strong> matrix was formed, where each row represented one base and the 36 columns included a 4-dimensional one-hot encoding of A/T/C/G and 32 normalized current values corresponding to that position.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Transformer classifier was trained with standard regularization and early stopping. Training and validation used xtg103 and the plasmid sample, while sal87 was held out for testing to prevent data leakage. The model projected inputs through six encoder layers with multi-head attention and GELU activation, followed by mean pooling and a multilayer perceptron classifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than reporting only a global modified fraction, I mapped model positive calls to genomic loci and compared them with single-nucleotide–resolution PT maps from Nick-seq. The overlap reached <strong>95.73%</strong>. This reproducible, configuration-driven workflow was implemented entirely by me, connecting preprocessing, model training, and biological validation (see Fig. 1).
